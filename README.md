# Support
Just simple star ‚≠êÔ∏è will make my life happier :) 

If you want to support this project, feel free to send some coffee money to this [link](paypal.me/dkalachniuk)
If you don't want to spend money, you can still support me if you will share this tool with your colleagues and tell them how nice it is and how it improved your workflow.

# Ideas
- add command to support carthage update
- add sorting to the list of projects
- add favorites projects
- configure the actions when you press on the project. so you will be able to see only those that you need

# TODO
- ~~update commands logic so some commands like: open workspace, open in finder will not use terminal to open the files~~
- ~~put action "open in Xcode" in the main view~~
- add Sparkle framework to check for updates automatically
