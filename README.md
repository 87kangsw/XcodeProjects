# Support
Just simple star ‚≠êÔ∏è will make my life happier :) 

If you want to support this project, feel free to send some coffee money to this [link](paypal.me/dkalachniuk)
If you don't want to spend money, you can still support me if you will share this tool with your colleagues.

# Ideas
- add command to support carthage update
- add sorting to the list of projects
- add favorites projects
- configure the actions when you press on the project. so you will be able to see only those that you need

# TODO
- ~~update commands logic so some commands like: open workspace, open in finder will not use terminal to open the files~~
- ~~put action "open in Xcode" in the main view~~
- ability to rename project name
- add Sparkle framework to check for updates automatically
